  	Hello World.
  </h1>
  <p>
  	Hey class, it's nice to virtually meet you! My name is is Giovanni Centeno and I am a third year Digital Humanities Major. 
	After graduating I plan on getting into the Usability field, so a I figured knowing some web design basics would definitely help. 
	I've taken an intro java course so I have a little foundation but have never attempted anything else which makes me nervous but excited to learn more. 
  </p>
  <p>
  	Good luck this semester guys!
